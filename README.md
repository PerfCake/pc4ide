# pc4ide

pc4ide's goal is to create graphical editor for [PerfCake](https://www.perfcake.org/) scenarios.

However it is not intended to use this editor directly (although it is possible), because it wouldn't bring you the full functionality needed for scenario editor. It is expected to use pc4ide as a plugin in your favourite IDE (eclipse, Idea and Netbeans will be supported). pc4ide's goal is to create common codebase for individual IDE plugins.
